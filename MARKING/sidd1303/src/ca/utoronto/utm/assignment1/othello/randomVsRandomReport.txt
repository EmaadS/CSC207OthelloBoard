RandomVSRandom Report

1) What is your conclusion, does the first or
second player have some advantage, at least for a random strategy?

Ans: Second player has an advantage as the probability of the player that goes second wins is ~50% while it is
~45% for the player that goes first.

2) Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA

3) Briefly write your thoughts on the above video below:

Ans: I found the "four recipes of hacking statistics" interesting. I am intrigued by how much easier
we can get statistical data from just writing for loops and not having to do complex math.

4) H0 is

Ans: A null hypothesis refers to a statement about a population parameter and reflects that there will be no difference
in tests and experiments.

H0: The win probability for player 1 and player 2 is the same.

5) Ha is

Ans: The Alternative Hypothesis refers to a statement that contradicts the H0 and suggests that an effect will take
place in tests and experiments.

Ha: Player 2 has a higher win probability than player 1.

6) Choose one of the following and delete the other:
   My experimental results do not support H0, so they support Ha

7) As in the video, use either math or code (add a Java Class) to argue for or against H0

Ans: I have used 10000 games to demonstrate that ~45% of the time player 1 wins while ~50% of the time, player 2 wins
(other ~5% are draws). This shows us that with random strategy, the player that goes second tends to win more games.
